# ComputeShaderProject
GPU Particle simulation project to learn to use compute shaders in Vulkan

![ComputeShader_NpyuakX4No](https://github.com/VincentPHAM98/ComputeShaderProject/assets/100954017/16af19e1-9716-4bc6-b858-e26af2807812)

I followed the [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Compute_Shader) on compute shaders and built on top of it

Features that I added:
- ImGui
- Follow cursor option
- Velocity based particle color

## Instalation

- Open the .sln
- Setup the project to link with Vulkan, glm and glfw as explained in https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Development_environment
- Run the program
